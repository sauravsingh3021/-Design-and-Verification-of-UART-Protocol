# Design-and-Verification-of-UART-Protocol

This project implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) module in Verilog, designed with flexibility and accuracy in mind.

🔧 Features
Parameterizable Baud Rate: Easily configurable for different communication speeds.

8-bit Data Transmission: Supports standard 8-bit data frames.

UART Protocol Implementation:

1 Start Bit

8 Data Bits

1 Stop Bit

Accurate Reception: 16x oversampling per bit to ensure reliable data capture.

🧪 Verification
Developed a SystemVerilog testbench for character-wise testing.

Verified serial transmission and reception of ASCII strings.
